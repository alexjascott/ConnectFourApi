# ConnectFourApi
Connect Four Restful API

Simple little API to facilitate a game of Connect 4. Developed rather quickly over the weekend, hopefully it will give a nod that I know a little bit of coding.

Libraries used;
- Spring boot
- Spring Rest (Jackson JSON serialisation/deserialisation, Javax validation)
- JUnit

Regards, Alex Scott.
