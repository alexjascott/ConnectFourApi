# ConnectFourApi
Connect Four Restful API

Simple little API to facilitate a game of Connect 4. Developed rather quickly over the weekend, hopefully it will give a nod that I know a little bit of coding. I'm sure there are some logic issues remaining (such as what happens when tokens get higher than the top of the game grid).

Libraries used;
- Spring boot
- Spring Rest
- Jackson JSON serialisation/deserialisation
- Javax validation
- JUnit

To use;
- "maven install"
- enter /target directory
- "java -jar connectfour-rest-api-1.0.0.jar"

Regards, Alex Scott.
